        <h3>Crime rate Predictions using the K-means algorithm</h3>
        <p>Crime rate Predictions using the K-means algorithm
We begin this list with one of the most exciting projects that you would be able to make. This is a great idea for CSE final year projects. You would need the dataset of crimes, and using the K-means algorithm, and you are required to predict the crime rate. This project has overarching importance in our society because we see an upward trend in the number of crimes committed daily.

Even the law enforcers are having a field day in trying to curb crimes in a particular part of the world. This project would help those law enforcers. All you have to do is feed the data of the crimes that have occurred in the past. The data which you enter would automatically be mined, and special care would be taken to ensure a smooth pipeline of the entire functioning of the project.

K-means algorithm would be at the heart of this project. It will help us in clustering all the things like co-offenders and also help us in finding the missing link that humans would have commonly missed. This project could really prove to be fruitful if you would be able to package everything like the model and the pipeline in an easy to use Graphical User Interface package which even the non-tech people would be able to enjoy.</p>

        <h3>A battery saver program for Android devices</h3>
        <p> A battery saver program for Android devices
Android devices are infamous for the amount of battery that they consume. Because Android is open-source, there are a lot of different devices out there. Optimizing apps for such a vast ecosystem is still a massive challenge for any app developer. Due to this poor optimization of apps, they tend to consume more battery.

Another reason which could be said for the rapid decline of the battery percentage is the poor ram and other resources management, which you would find on the third party reskin of stock android. Your task in this project would be to create a battery saver app to help this omnipotent issue. This battery saver should be built natively for android.

You can use a few different tricks like stooping the apps running in the background by force, ensuring that the user is notified of any app is draining large chunks of battery. Finally, you can also use ram management to your advantage by limiting the number of apps that are opened at any given time.

      <h3> Fingerprint voting system</h3>
	 <p> Fingerprint voting system
These major projects for cse have the potential to touch a lot of lives. Since all the fingerprints in this world are unique, this project leverages that exact fact. The specifics on how you implement the project lie in your hand, but you can try out different things like automatically casting a vote when the machine recognizes the finger print, Only unlocking the voting interface when the machine reads your fingerprint correctly, etc.

This project in democratic countries would help in doing the elections more fair and overall work in favor of democracy. It would be best if you gave this project a try because it will test out a number of tech stacks at a time.</p>
